# Fortunate Ancient Debris

Get additional netherite scraps by using a fortune pickaxe on ancient debris. For balance, you don't get xp from mining ancient debris, and netherite is slightly more expensive (five scraps instead of four).

Explosions have no effect. Silk touch will give you the ancient debris block, which you can still smelt for xp.
